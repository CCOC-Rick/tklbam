===================
v1.4.1 Release Notes
====================

support for more secure Hub IAM role type temporary credentials
---------------------------------------------------------------

* implemented internal stsagent command

* added support for multiple credential types (e.g., devpay, iamrole,
  iamuser)

* updated dependencies: newer version of tklbam-python-boto with STS
  agent support, python-dateutil (using this to parse

* fallback to local registry path if global paths in non-writeable paths

  rational:
  
  1) allow tklbam to be used by a non-root user
  2) make testing easier

* duplicity.py: allow graceful degradation of functionality when not running as root

* backup: fatal error on bad subapikey if no cached credentials or iamrole credentials

* added python-dateutil dependency

improve generic Debian/Ubuntu support
-------------------------------------

* ez-apt-install.sh: cut and paste convenience script that can be piped from wget

  Rational: make installation on Ubuntu/Debian ridiculously easy
  
  Usage::
  
      # I feel lucky
      wget -O - -q https://raw.github.com/turnkeylinux/tklbam/master/contrib/ez-apt-install.sh | PACKAGE=tklbam /bin/bash
  
      # I feel cautious
      wget https://raw.github.com/turnkeylinux/tklbam/master/contrib/ez-apt-install.sh
      cat ez-apt-install.sh
      chmod +x
      ./ez-apt-install.sh tklbam

* created detect-profile internal command

  rational: primitive for generic Ubuntu/Debian support

* profile_id detection for non-TurnKey systems

documentation improvements
--------------------------

* fixed man page for tklbam-init.txt to be in sync with embedded usage

* added Features section to docs/tklbam.txt

* tweaked and improved FAQ, added question on how to tune a backup

* updated FAQ to clarify supported Linux systems, storage backends and databases

* committed fix to fixclock hook to explain how to change ntp server

debugging improvements
----------------------

* removed some of the obstacles to running tklbam as a non-root user
  (e.g., useful for testing/debugging, or with --raw-upload /
  --raw-download) mode
