==================
v1.1 Release Notes
==================

* UI fixes

  - init
  
    - aded --force option to support re-initialization of TKLBAM
    - increased robustness of stdin input of APIKEY
    - added API-KEY validity check to tklbam-init (save round-trip)
    - catch scary looking tracebacks on initialization

  - backup
  
    - handle BackupAccount.NotFound error, raise NotSubscribedError
    - removed --asynchronous-upload option (trade off better performance
      on high speed networks with improved transparency)
    - If user isn't subscribed, print out instructions, not a traceback

  - restore: 
  
    - usepty=True in restore to prevent dpkg output from going crazy
    - support --noninteractive mode (e.g., don't prompt or retry passphrases)

  - added new status command (improve TKLBAM-Core integration)
  - escrow: added -R flag as shortcut for --random-passphrase (convenience)
  - list: size in megabytes instead of gigabytes (better resolution)

* bugfixes

  - increase nofile rlimit to 8192 (needed by long backup chains)
  - don't tell the Hub to update the backup in simulate mode!
  - add --allow-source-mismatch option to duplicity (otherwise Duplicity
    refuses to backup if the hostname changes)
  - if we skipped restoring files, don't try to rollback files
  - rollback not just packages but package dependencies as well
  - pidlock tklbam-backup so it doesn't run more than once
  - chmod 600 the contents of the escrow key (may be sensitive)
  - workaround for webmin getpass.getpass bug on Lucid
