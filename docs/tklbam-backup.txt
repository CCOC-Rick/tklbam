SYNOPSIS
========

tklbam-backup [ -options ] [ override ... ]

ARGUMENTS
=========

`<override>` := ``<filesystem-override>`` | ``<database-override>``

Overrides are usually configured in /etc/tklbam/overrides.

Filesystem overrides
--------------------

``<filesystem-override>`` := -?/path/to/include/or/exclude

This includes or excludes additional files and directories from being 
backed up if they've changed since installation.

Overrides defaults in /var/lib/tklbam/profile/dirindex.conf

Gotchas:

* If you add a directory handled by package management this may break
  package management on the system you restore to.

* Only changes (e.g., new files, edited files, deleted files) from the
  base installation are included in a backup.

Examples::

    # exclude log files in /var/www
    -/var/www/*/logs

    # ignores changes to webmin configuration
    -/etc/webmin

    # include the contents of an external hard disk...
    /mnt/images

Database overrides
------------------

``<database-override>`` := -?mysql:database[/table]

By default ALL databases are backed up. Adding a positive override
changes the default behavior so that only the database or table
specified in the override is included in the backup.

You can mix positive overrides with negative overrides.

Examples::

    # exclude Drupal6 sessions table
    -mysql:drupal6/sessions

    # only include drupal6 database
    mysql:drupal6

OPTIONS
=======

--address=TARGET_URL      manual backup target URL.
                          Default: automatically configured via Hub

--simulate, -s            Simulate operation. Don't actually backup.
                          Useful for inspecting /TKLBAM by hand.

--quiet, -q               Be less verbose

--logfile=PATH            Path of file to log output to.
                          Default: /var/log/tklbam-backup

Configurable options
--------------------

--volsize MB              Size of backup volume in MBs.
                          Default: 50

--full-backup FREQUENCY   Time frequency of full backup.
                          Default: 1M

                          <frequency> := <int>[DWM]

                            e.g.,::

                                3D - three days
                                2W - two weeks
                                1M - one month

Resolution order for configurable options:

1) comand line (highest precedence)
2) configuration file (/etc/tklbam/conf)::

      # comment
      <option-name> <value>

3) built-in default (lowest precedence)
